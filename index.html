<p>You walk into a caf√© and you see me, tucked in one of the corners by the light. I have a green flip note opened and an empty cup on the table. I was probably writing earlier but now I am just doodling an overcomplicated machine with a six-handed clock entangled with the stems of an almost-plant. My second cup arrives and I say thank you as I see you and fumble to stand up to greet. Hello.</p>
