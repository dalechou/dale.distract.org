<h1>Dale Chou's painting</h1>
<p>I am a beginner just starting to paint. I paint with oil on canvas.</p>
<p>I have a long way to go, but I appreciate the journey.</p>

<p>I am very much still in the exploratory phase, so the work shown here may be sanded down and painted over at a later time. It all depends on what I am working on, and how much space I have at home.</p>
<p>I am also going to write down my <a href='./setup.html'>setup</a>, hoping that it is helpful to people out there.</p>
<p>Please use the <a href='../contact.html'>contact page</a> to reach out.</p>
