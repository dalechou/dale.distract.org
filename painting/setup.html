<h1>Dale Chou's setup</h1>
<p>I am keeping a record of my setup, which has significantly improved my quality of life. As I am just starting out, there may be better options out there that I do not know. I only hope to share information and make <a href='./index.html'>painting</a> more accessible in some small way.</p>
<p>I am not affiliated with these products. This is a record of what I am using, not a recommendation of quality products.</p>
<h2>Oil bath</h2>
<p>I use Hollywood safflower oil to soak my unused brushes.</p>
<h2>Palette paper</h2>
<p>I use palette paper to avoid cleaning out the palette.</p>
