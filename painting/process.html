<p>I am keeping a record of my process and setup, which has significantly improved my quality of life. As I am just starting out, there may be better options out there that I do not know. I only hope to share information and make <a href='./index.html'>painting</a> more accessible in some small way. <i>Nulla dies sine linea.</i></p>
<p>I am not affiliated with the products listed. This is a record of what I am using, not a recommendation of quality.</p>
<h1>Glasses</h1>
<p>I am trying this thing where I take advantage of my nearsightedness and take off my glasses to help with blocking out larger spaces of colours. I only put them back on when I work on the details.</p>
<h1>Linseed oil</h1>
<p>I put it in a plastic bottle with a narrow opening and just squeeze to use.</p>
<h1>Oil bath</h1>
<p>I use Hollywood safflower oil to soak my unused brushes.</p>
<h1>Palette paper</h1>
<p>I use palette paper to avoid cleaning out the palette.</p>
