<h1>Le cri</h1>
<pre>
As if to protrude his pain, 
He broke away from his peers
With a few quick steps. 
He gasped beside the dark water—and cried. 
The fiery air has collapsed
Thickly on his dream—his voice 
Was smothered by the green. 
The outcry—seeking an exit, 
Broke through the glassy-skeletal-eyes—
But mauve was his shriek, which made 
A picture frame he could not complete.
