<h1>Le cri</h1>
<pre>
As if to protrude his pain, 
He broke away from his peers
With a few quick steps. 
He gasped beside the dark water -- and cried. 
The fiery air has collapsed
Thickly on his dream -- his voice 
Was smothered by the green. 
The outcry -- seeking an exit, 
Broke through the glassy-skeletal-eyes --
But mauve was his shriek, which made 
A picture frame he could not complete.
