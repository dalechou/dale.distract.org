<h1>You hate me</h1>
<pre>
I was taken by how the blue
Light engulfed
The orange afternoon. 
It sliced the world in segments. 
The birds were singing for the death

Before the tempest. 
From here, things twisted
And they were a little tilted, 
Too. I was able to see my family
Through the thin

Bladed glimpse of light. 
It was just a gap. 
The tap dripped on nevertheless, ignored
The time. It ignored my room; my prison—
The prisoners; and my shelter.

There were too much yelling out there, and pride
Stuck to each of us like how possession did. 
She accused. 
She stabbed. 
She hurt.

I minimised myself
To fit, until
I became a dust
In their eyes. I brought only pain, 
Anger, and despair—for myself, only fear.
