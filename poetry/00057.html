<h1>Furano</h1>
<pre>
Fields—one wider
Than the other—
Sometimes occupying the roadside
With green patches of life—other 
Times, several lavender hills—
They gave the

Free-falling

Bicycle 
Wheels

A sudden turn of purple visage.

No one ever told me
About the blue mysterious fox, 
So I had to make up the story.

'Once upon a time—'

We chased
The trains, 
The hills, 
The kimono-wrapped girls, and the 
Ice cream cones in their hands. 
We chased the rain. We
Chased each other through the plain—

This, a story-land—and 
I could taste the morning
With my skin. 
Everything went against the weather forecast—

And I loved it.

The clouds here made me think of people far away. 
I closed my eyes under the sun
And wondered 
If I was a caffeine substitute
For you—

And you, a caffeinated addict.

As I left and fell asleep on the train, 
I had questions in my palms. 
Night came and gone—at
Some hour between last night and this morning
I was lost—and when
The white foam formed a ring
Around that black rock, 
I wanted to

Jump.
