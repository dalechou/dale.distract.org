<h1>Furano</h1>
<pre>
Fields -- one wider
Than the other --
Sometimes occupying the roadside
With green patches of life -- other 
Times, several lavender hills --
They gave the

Free-falling

Bicycle 
Wheels

A sudden turn of purple visage.

No one ever told me
About the blue mysterious fox, 
So I had to make up the story.

"Once upon a time --"

We chased
The trains, 
The hills, 
The kimono-wrapped girls, and the 
Ice-cream cones in their hands. 
We chased the rain.  We
Chased each other through the plain --

This, a story-land -- and 
I could taste the morning
With my skin. 
Everything went against the weather forecast --

And I loved it.

The clouds here made me think of people far away. 
I closed my eyes under the sun
And wondered 
If I was a caffeine substitute
For you --

And you, a caffeinated addict.

As I left and fell asleep on the train, 
I had questions in my palms. 
Night came and gone -- at
Some hour between last night and this morning
I was lost -- and when
The white foam formed a ring
Around that black rock, 
I wanted to

Jump.
