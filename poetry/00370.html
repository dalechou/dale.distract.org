<h1>The standoff</h1>
<pre>
This corridor is too long
For the both of us. It must be done.
We approach the midpoint with caution, planting each step 
In equal measures. A nod was suggested, 
Barely enough to qualify for proper acknowledgement,
But the concealment is no more.

We have made allowances, and
Only one of us shall come out on top.
Only one can survive this, staring head on 
And strong; whilst the other averts
Gaze to some random thought manifested as

A paint peel or 
A small defect newly discovered 
On the wall, a dent 
Maybe, even a strain of heels for sudden reroute. 

The course
Has always been a matter of great fascination. 
Meanwhile, we pass.

My nod completes the form.
You look onwards, unaffected,

Unscathed.
