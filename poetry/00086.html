<h1>Persephone</h1>
<pre>
Your eyes carried those childhood anamneses 
That I have lost and forgot—
Memories that I have missed and cradled 
Carefully before my sleep—with every blink 
My heart lived—and as if something 
Much younger than my present age has slumbered 
Deep inside me all along—has stirred to meet.

Then you looked away—
And as Hades has turned the land to heath
That chilled through what seemed much longer 
Than how winters did last—my Elysium was lost—
And the air seemed a little harder to breathe.
