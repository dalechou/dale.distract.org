<h1>Persephone</h1>
<pre>
Your eyes carried those childhood anamneses 
That I have lost and forgot -- 
Memories that I have missed and cradled 
Carefully before my sleep -- with every blink 
My heart lived -- and as if something 
Much younger than my present age has slumbered 
Deep inside me all along -- has stirred to meet.

Then you looked away -- 
And as Hades has turned the land to heath
That chilled through what seemed much longer 
Than how winters did last -- my Elysium was lost --
And the air seemed a little harder to breathe.
