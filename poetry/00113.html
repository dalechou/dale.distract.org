<h1>The criminal</h1>
<pre>
A tube of viscera 
Spooled the death-sprawl—salty 
Plop-like blur. I've had enough 
Of the bad dreams—

Murdered night after night—by the dispassionate 
Rouge that haunted (and left 
Red claw marks on my eyes)—as I stole
Gasps of air, echoing the heaving torso, 
Waking up for my sight.

Diaries of alpha-numerals, such—sentenced his 
Crime. (Ill-lucked rat-faced criminal! 
Caught 
red-handed.) 
Please, thank us 
For our kindness—it was humane. Death 
By asphyxiation (the paper said so)—then
To talk about it.

My white coat matched his; mocked his—
With my warm large hand, I sent him
Back to the cage.
