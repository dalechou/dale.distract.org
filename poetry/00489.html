<h1>I wolfed it down like warm lead</h1>
<pre>
I wolfed it down like warm lead 
and heard the hum 
distinctive to heavy machinery 
shutting down.  

The drums continued to pound, 
but no longer violent, now 
dictated by a beat foreign 
to my own.  I waited.  

Something was clearly working.  
The wave that was meant to set me 
awash and toppled 
and brute stop the blaring night.  It was coming.  

I could sense its 
warmth teasing my limbs.  The sound 
of fabrics rubbing 
against each other, 

acknowledging.  Then -- 
the dim light.  
It was purple again.  Then 
nothing.
