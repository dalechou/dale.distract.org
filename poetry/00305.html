<h1>Band of poets</h1>
<pre>
This band of poets like to gather.
This band of poets feel the need to join hands.
This band of poets enjoy each other's company,
And talk of poetry -- O the misery, O the agony.

This band of poets work in advertising.
This band of poets have their own brochure.
Yellow pamphlets designed to bring you around --
Tick here, sign here, and now you are in.

This band of poets operate in systems.
Representation and functions are important --
They fit in the heirarchy, the pecking order:
Scratch my back, and I just might scratch yours!

This band of poets have drums and fanfare --
This band of poets hold trumpets with a banner.
This band of poets are loud and proud -- and content
To be this band of poets.
