<h1>Band of poets</h1>
<pre>
This band of poets like to gather.
This band of poets feel the need to join hands.
This band of poets enjoy each other's company,
And talk of poetry—O the misery, O the agony.

This band of poets work in advertising.
This band of poets have their own brochure.
Yellow pamphlets designed to bring you around—
Tick here, sign here, and now you are in.

This band of poets operate in systems.
Representation and functions are important—
They fit in the heirarchy, the pecking order:
Scratch my back, and I just might scratch yours!

This band of poets have drums and fanfare—
This band of poets hold trumpets with a banner.
This band of poets are loud and proud—and content
To be this band of poets.
