<h1>Cicada trees<br /><span class="dedication">-- dedicated to S</span></h1>
<pre>
This letter that I send 
To you must travel -- 

Must first plunge into the darkness 
With confetti of words, with the symbols of my calling --

Must taste the metallic bitter of rain and iron 
And dwell 
In the coldness to preserve memory 

In rations overwhelming to ten-thousand miles --
Must reason and turn 
To evoke a hot summer: cicada trees warming to ears and
The scarcity of nights that fold 
Easily in their pillars of dreams --

Must be stamped (several times) 
And deliver like Chinese whispers
The entire collection of my shadows in exchange 
For yours --

Must have breakfast by the posts --
Must cross deserts and streams --
Must endure 
Silence and uncertainty -- a world's end 
Every seven seconds as I blink by and by the time --

Must reach; must yearn --
Discard beat and breath
And balance for the crash of embrace that smears 
So dearly even the frames of souls --

Must drink from your palms 
To revive 
Like a dry leaf 
Holding on to a tree dreaming of poetry

And be read.
