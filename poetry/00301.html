<h1>You write again</h1>
<pre>
It makes me sad to see you
Write again.  You didn't before.
You couldn't. And why not?

Did I stop you
In some way unspeakable?
Did I serve as a siphon to your thoughts
That words somehow remained high
Above life and fire in a sphere of glass?

And only now that
The heat is off, are allowed once more
To return
To the most basic, most natural?

Could it be that we were liars
And our attachments were in essence
Perversions from the truth, and so
We were cursed with
The darker vowels, too heavy
To forge the worlds
With our trying tongues?

No matter. You write again,
Here and now in full iteration
To declare us false.
