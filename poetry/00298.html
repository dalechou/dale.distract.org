<h1>Flying economy</h1>
<pre>
Flying economy from Shanghai to Taipei, I discovered that
The nearest armrest was in fact disputed territory:

A metal jut
Slippery and cold,
Covered by the sea's greenery.

The tiny woman to my left had barred it with her bones. 
One wrist positioned to secure occupation

Too awkward to pass. And she knew it well—

Until a quick jot—an opportune turbulence
Pummelled red jumper head-first against slight withdraw.

Arms of threading furled as
I advanced yard by yard in clear resolve,
Camping now my warm hand by her shore.

Too late to retreat now. She was set.
And we took off.
