<h1>A gift</h1>
<pre>
Patient like a reader—
You have carefully placed
Soft murmurs on my lips
As I whispered your name in
Restful nights of 
Nocturnes, quiet sounds, and light in disguise. 
They have led ways to far away places, 
And made beds for brooding emotions—
These things revealed growing dependence, 
And that was a frightening thing indeed! 
Nevertheless, there was also something 
More convincing than fear—my love 
That dared to depend again—
On you—
And for that 
Nights like tonight would stir peacefully
Time and again, with your company.
