<h1>Sacrilege</h1>
<pre>
<span class='part'>Morning (six o'clock)</span>

An age-dried corpse pithed itself on the tree
Like a spread-out ample sail hung proudly. 
From that tree Life and Death shared a decree; 
Through malodor they spoke their pact loudly. 
I punctured three holes
In my aspen-wrist—with a kiss—then cheated
The brooding blood so they flooded
With eye-splinter colour—
The summer-sun shaded shadows that slipped and
Flipped-flopped their lives
From those death-bound doors.

<span class='part'>Midday</span>

There were hurry beats of feathers and wings
That captured a dire drama of harvest. 
The music box bird-caged its steel-bound sins
And wept for what it has clawed for the fire-feast. 
There were thirteen
Knocks on the vacant wood—
She's no mood to 
Play her childish pastime.
A small chime echoed the purple
Forest to bring rest and peace
To the ancient ghosts—like good hosts
We shunned them beneath the sand.

<span class='part'>Evening (five o'clock)</span>

It was there, the skeletal-grey tower, 
With the white fear-filled bed dominated. 
Anguish twirled the bed sheet in the centre—
There she once struggled—to be sedated. 
She, a tired blood-stained dove
In the evening, flew, diving—to cloak
The morbid window light 
O' the night—she shone darkness
Fervidly, vividly, and beautifully morose—
Like a rose, she bled red
In my garden.

<span class='part'>Night (nine o'clock)</span>

The nocturnal fear has tempted and tried—
'Til it became dark—a child sobbed and cried.
