<h1>The Yaoyaos<br /><span class="dedication">â€”dedicated to Cori</span></h1>
<pre>
The Yaoyaos dwelled in Shuimijiao were known 
to be so obnoxious and noisy 
that everyone decided to shun them.
  
One day, the Yaoyaos approached the old community, 
and apologised profusely, for forgiveness 
and absolution. 
A respected member of the community 
stopped the laden Yaoyaos, "Why 
are you apologising now 
after all these years? Stop crying. 
Tell the truth!"

"The Kadus have moved in. 
And they are more obnoxious 
and noisy than we ever were 
or could be. 

Please let us join you again. 
We cannot take it anymore!"
