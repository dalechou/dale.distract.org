<h1>Ode to the carpark lady</h1>
<pre>
     It was
This reverend position that she held
For fifteen years: a true lady
Of healthy disposition, of noble composition.
The Guardian of Vehicles, Keeper of Chariots.
     And on weekends, just someone trying to help,
     To make a difference.  To serve
As an indispensable element of our society.

She registered daily on her chair, or nightly
If her shift so required, an impressive list of
Titles: BMW and Volvo, Lexus and Mercedes,
The assemblage of Isuzu, Suzuki, and Subaru,
     Of Mazda, Toyota, and Honda...
     In a nutshell
She was an earnest gentlewoman
Most loyal to her responsibilities.

     Until one windy night
When the lunar eye pressed upon the sky
     She drove.  She drove
     And drove her happy nails
Against the multicultural charade.
     (A rainbow-shaded parade...)
So as the city rose three hours later:
     Rose with it the red belt of Sunday.
