<h1>The sparrow</h1>
<pre>
It was told that the sparrow
Was made from stone—a matter
Of subtraction—made light, 
Let live—a hardness hollowed, 
A weight removed, and changed
Like a season subdued;

But the sparrow remained still
And would not soar, not high,
Not until it was split—from the tail,
A serious cut, a severe tear—
A break from gravity!—and it was up!
Up! in the air.
