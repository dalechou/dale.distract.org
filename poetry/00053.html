<h1>A smile</h1>
<pre>
Last night, after 
A long summer day, I crept
Into the shower

(Tap-tap-tap-tap, I tiptoed like that!)
And tried hard not to wake-up anyone.

It wasn't long before something small
Glittered (along with soap 
Bubbles and water) beneath
Layers of foam—bursting through a few bubbles, 
I picked the petite ornament up, and saw that
It was grandmother's earring—
No longer in pair—but still shimmering.

Minutes later, I walked into her room
And showed it to her. 
She was a little embarrassed, but 
She welcomed its return nevertheless. 
Then—she smiled—like a child—
I noticed how little teeth were left, 
And how the smile's gone mild.
