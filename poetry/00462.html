<h1>The almost-howling man</h1>
<pre>
It was an almost-howl. 
He extended his throat, now protruding away from his torso. 

This pale little man 
throbbed like an angry pistol. His song was his own—foreign—

a far-cry discernible even two blocks away. He was away—
so far 

away—not even here. He sang-screamed-cried—bubbled up 
with great jugular angst; he

released 
another almost-howl.
