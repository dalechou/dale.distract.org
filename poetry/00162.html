<h1>The counting</h1>
<pre>
I collect the daystars from the maidenhair;
The blackbirds had hung them there.

With their birdly hooks they stretched
The dawns: the innards of men
And the ever-mourning dusks.

A paler bow-tie they had made for
Death -- a fitting colar of the Sunday tress.
     (I avoid Sunday's soft caress
But instead seek solace today.)  Now, when

The stars ferment and yield
And stretch into the sickled moons,
I shall have no place to turn

But to hold my knees against the dust.  And count
Days like these like pennies
Of a financier's task: the greatest sum of all that
Was left behind.

Would the blackbirds question
Then as I carefully wallow through the dreams
(With their wings

     Carefully trimmed):
          Won't you follow?
          Won't you follow?
