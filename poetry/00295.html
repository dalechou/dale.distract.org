<h1>I stand by the road</h1>
<pre>
I stand by the road 
Watching my friends go.
We were not close, 
But I know their names. 

I know where they are going—
That fiery place.
They grow wary from the journey
And what it means to travel

To a place where words fail 
And languages expire. I know
Down that road, they only have 
To write for pens to break

And fingers curl; only have to read 
For books to burn and crumble;
Only have to speak, for all consents 
To resign all desires and let go.

I know that place all too well,
Which is why I stand here
Still by the road
And plead: do not go
