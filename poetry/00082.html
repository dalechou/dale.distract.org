<h1>Memorandum</h1>
<pre>
A few things 
One could never get used to:

The bitter taste of cold 
Black coffee that lurked thickly
Above one's throat 
Like last night's languor, 
And that unbecoming fatigue 
Of Monday morning -- both seemingly difficult 
To discard.

Likewise
Those time-burnt photographs and 
Eye-stinging onion peels, rifted by scissors
And knives -- nobody bled, but 
The wound ached nevertheless.

Or the day -- that day -- when 
The flat-voice of a grandmother
Ailed over the telephone, speaking 
Wishfully of euthanasia.

Then argued --
Her sour-pickled spine shook to make fists 
With folded hands -- 
Those limbs cracked aflame 
As if to spark life.  Then rest
Shortly afterwards, worn-out 
Like an old doll ragged and placed 
Peacefully -- back on the chair.

These are a few things 
Arduous to bear.
