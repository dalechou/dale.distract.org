<h1>I only age when<br><span class="dedication">—dedicated to Choco</span></h1>
<pre>
I only age when I walk with you 
Exactly as we did

That Sunday morning: 
Headed to the breakfast shop for sandwich and tea; 

Then picked up
Tomorrow's bread from the nearby bakery—

"And some cake, too, please," 
You said,

I agreed, hand holding yours 
In happy synchrony; we were going 

For a small date, and for a brief moment
I saw all lives of the season relit

And all reasons made sense—
Only to be left asunder again.
