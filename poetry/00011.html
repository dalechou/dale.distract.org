<h1>Nocturnal city</h1>
<pre>
I look away. 
I look around
This concrete jungle. 
This metallic cage. 
I am lost, and the tyrannical rain reminds me of
The pain that night. 
There is no crossroad in front of me, just
A slippery path, guides me to
Move on. 
With a feverish headache, I promise not to
Collapse. 
I hear myself screaming silently. 
I hear myself whispering. 
This is the city of the rain. 
You can choose to wake up, 
Or wake up anyway, 
And listen to them trickle
Across this world. 
Across this longest night of the nights
They run blindly and
Wildly across your face, 
Making your warm eyes cold, 
Paralysing them from opening, 
Threatening them from telling the story. 
Your vacant sight casts everywhere and
Refuses without a question
Nor an answer.
