<h1>Words of the Night</h1>
<pre>
I had learnt from my OED Word of the Day subscription that
Tuesnight is the night before Tuesday, and not Tuesday night.

I imagine when Tiwesniht was a word in use,
Schedules were accounted for with the rise of the moon,

Starting 'days' with proper dresses for a good first sleep;
Only to rouse again, midnight, well-restored and ready

For great accomplishments: thoughts and inventions (or procreation
Under the lunar influence);

Then another sleep—a second setting
Of dreams and fantasies till the morning after; the sun rose

With indifferent warmth to finish the day,
Sealing off the light at noon.

There were other nights, of course, such as Wednesnight, Frinight,
And Sunnight. I wonder if Sunnight was an oxymoron.

I know now that Frinight later on consumed enough of fear
To be full of fright. But was it so terrible really, Thursday night?

Was it the anticipation in waiting
For the works of Frige? I can think of worse terms though

Coming from Tiw or Woden or Thunor, just to name a few—
Upon the Words of the Night,

My thoughts conclude;
As the night renews new terrors, waiting to befall the day.
