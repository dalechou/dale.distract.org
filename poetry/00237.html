<h1>The expecting</h1>
<pre>
An experience expected 
Is an experience lost.
How would you have me put it? 
Greatly, 
Of course. But how? 

This art, this craft of physical alteration, 
Making mass out of nothing 
Is difficult, so difficult.
Sometimes I sever a personal portion 
By opprobrious disguise—sealing it off

To display creation, to feign that I have,
But I don't. Not always. 
Even in the rare moments that I do, 
I employ some mathematical trickery:
A skirmish of ideas, 

A brawl of definitions—
An open-ended excursion, leaving
A slight of a door 
Ajar, by design, just wide 
Enough for a tempted mind

And something great (for it must be!)
By the end of the line.
