<h1>The specimen keeper</h1>
<pre>
The specimen keeper keeps specimens of fire
In the form of ash. 
It is an ageist business. There is no doubt
That the younger samples are often 
The most attractiveâ€”the keeper himself was 
One of them many years ago,

But he is no more. Now he is old
And distracted 
And running out of patience. Fire swim by him 
And never seem to settle like they used to.
His fire is out, they said, 
Poor old keeper. 

What they do not realise though
Is that he is willing. He is willing 
To stir like no other. He is willing to sweep through the ash 
To salvage that small heat. And that 
In the difficult art of fire keeping
Still makes a difference.
