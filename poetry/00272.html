<h1>Caps</h1>
<pre>
In the factory men and women
Wore caps for good colour-coding.
I had Pink when I first came in,

Until the Lead in Yellow dropped by
To announce for my promotion to White,
And donned me another cap.

A ritual change, which fitted well.
Everyone could see my new avail.
Just as well as I could see

Far into the corner of his office,
The full sitting wallow of the Boss
With his unmistakable Blue.

I know now that a change of view is
As quick as a change of cap, but
The change of caps is less apparent

Still, remains immutable, therefore
Imperishableâ€”a permanent base with a
Progressive head, for good colour-coding.
