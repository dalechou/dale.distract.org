Always with a roar.                  <i>On your way home</i>
It came loud! Proud rumble           <i>blazing lightning and fire</i>
Shaking warm earth with
Musical thunder. She heard and ran,  <i>like inevitability—</i>
Blazing through the sunset fields.   <i>like the thunder,</i>
Her face pumped and full             <i>you'll find me</i>
Of light. She leapt
                                     <i>believing that</i>
To grasp at the door, to swing       <i>I am here to be found:</i>
It open like a clasp forced wide.
Lips bent double. O proud rumble!    <i>a complicated dial</i>
Great rumble, quaking her            <i>that you may pass</i>
Quiet figure now with a sigh,        <i>'midst one of the paths</i>
Pummelling headlong
And fast through her heart,          <i>waiting</i>
                                     <i>there. In your favourite dress,</i>
Electrifying her arms,
Her fulminated fingers and           <i>I'll seek you out</i>
Lightning touch. There she           <i>through the Texan fields</i>
Wrote. Wrote and wrote               <i>like a hurricane</i>
Through the roar—not with
Pen and ink, but with strokes        <i>and turn—you must—oh</i>
Of fiery bright thorns.              <i>I'll have you turned.</i>

Always with a roar,                  <i>On your way home</i>
Too fast, too exact!                 <i>bruised and tired</i>
In the field of thunder
Sometimes they hit too               <i>like inevitability—</i>
Close to home. She fell              <i>like a departed train</i>
As she started to run,               <i>you have left me</i>
Red ankles over
                                     <i>believing that</i>
Pale knots of grass.                 <i>I am lost, forever:</i>
The clouds seemed to
Move a little                        <i>a complicated dial</i>
As she fell a little                 <i>battered by the bullet rain.</i>
Hard-pressed kissing                 <i>A better time stopped</i>
The warm sweet earth, feeling the
Full weight                          <i>waiting</i>
                                     <i>for today, forever hopeful. Perhaps</i>
Tumbling through. She held a
Fistful of fire, but too late.       <i>I'll seek you out</i>
The land had stirred, then paused.   <i>this time</i>
The rumble passed, now               <i>through a different weather</i>
In search for another
Conductible vessel                   <i>and turn—you must—oh</i>
Ready and true!                      <i>I must have you turned.</i>

<span class='part'>iii</span>

Always with a roar.                  <i>I'll have you turned,</i>
Always with fire and light!          <i>and turn you must—oh</i>
Proud rumble,
This time a little closer.           <i>like a hurricane</i>
This time just within reach          <i>through the Texan fields.</i>
To make a grab                       <i>I'll seek you out</i>
For the mighty stretch—
                                     <i>there in your favourite dress,</i>
To make a step worth                 <i>waiting</i>
Falling over for—cling on to
The electrifying tail,               <i>'midst one of the paths</i>
The burning end of the next          <i>that you may pass.</i>
Great tale, then tug fiercely        <i>A complicated dial:</i>
Towards her own
Heart and head filling up wholly,    <i>I am here to be found,</i>
                                     <i>believing that</i>
With matching throbs thundering
Just as great. A passage             <i>You'll find me</i>
Re-opened for the lightning words.   <i>like the thunder,</i>
Proud rumble, caught and turned      <i>like inevitability</i>
Into impeccable verses just
Rightly written, like a fair copy    <i>blazing lightning and fire</i>
Impressed upside down.               <i>on your way home.</i>
