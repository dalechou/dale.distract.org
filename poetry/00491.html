<h1>Saturday morning dad jokes<br><span class='dedication'>—dedicated to Cori</span></h1>
<pre>
Cori sat next to me and 
could not stop giggling, 
as I pulled one joke 
after another 
from my reservoir of dad jokes. 
The one where the baby tomato 
had to ketchup; the one about 
seagulls and bagels; and the 
very best one, 
with the ducklings 
and their sunglasses 
and the zoo and the seaside. 

My mind was both there and 
elsewhere. It was 25 km away
another summer
with Cori and her sunglasses 
and the sea. And there 
she also giggled
over the emeraldcrests and the
prickly hot sand.
