<h1>On the subject of unsleep</h1>
<pre>
This is an austere apology from
Morpheus, who fled from the dream of Hypnos
    For a softer rest.

Arrested was the notion of unsleep:
A scabrous spot of September preserved
    Like frigid starfish.

The severed hourglass by the pillow was
Reclaimed—dug-dug the graves of time; hook gripped
    Inside: one soul trapped.

And between eyelids—enormity bred.
One monster made. One blasphemy unkind and
    One black knot undone.

Still. Every night the blanket would lit the
Malaise of unsleep; with his limned eyes he
    Crawled. Cold as his dream.
