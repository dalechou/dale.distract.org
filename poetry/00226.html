<h1>Know that</h1>
<pre>
Know that I had plans to bind 
You with mysteries.  Know that these words were
Meant for you.  Know that I was only reluctant 
As you were eager.  Know that I was tired 
Beyond repair.  Know that of course it was true, 
It was measured in coffee spoon.  Know that I 
Placed them in a cup, and rationed 
Meticulously, cube by cube.  Know that 
The cold got the better of us.  Know 
That each page was written with a fold, 
At the edge of the corner, with a certain hope 
Of not having to know -- after all.
