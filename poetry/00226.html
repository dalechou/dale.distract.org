<h1>Know that</h1>
<pre>
Know that I had plans to bind 
You with mysteries. Know that these words were
Meant for you. Know that I was only reluctant 
As you were eager. Know that I was tired 
Beyond repair. Know that of course it was true, 
It was measured in coffee spoon. Know that I 
Placed them in a cup, and rationed 
Meticulously, cube by cube. Know that 
The cold got the better of us. Know 
That each page was written with a fold, 
At the edge of the corner, with a certain hope 
Of not having to know—after all.
