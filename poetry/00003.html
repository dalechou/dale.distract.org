<h1>The finale</h1>
<pre>
It came too soon. 
If only I knew I didn't have much time. 
I would stay by her
At every chapter of her life, 
Night and day. 
Blinked by, 
Sooner than how the teardrops fell
From the end of the eyelashes
To the ground. 
Not even
The hurting sensation, 
The cold
And the forgot. 
It came after the fall, 
Soon the images would be all
That I have left to cherish. 
She perished. 
Pretence and the games—
Hide and seek. 
Came. 
Gone. 
The falling star would surely
Ride across the sky
As the legends promised, 
And the ending was all that would be remembered?
