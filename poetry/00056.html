<h1>The trial of a public enemy</h1>
<pre>
Two circles were formed: 
The inner circumference 
Formed a ring of emptiness (hollow
And vacant their eyes glowed), and
The outer border compassed with
Judgemental hatred (but
I saw their faces framed—frightfully with fear).

Apparently, she's intruded the harmony, 
And invaded this world (this
Confined box—the claustrophobic breathed
Hard against the glass—through the window, 
Gasping for air—and felt a lot better). 
Like primitive humanoids she placed herself right 
In the centre, and questioned her chorus.

Her lunacy's her most eloquent alibi—she was not here. 
Like a beast, escaped and out of place, 
She sneered at the passengers around her
And sat down (more people moved 
Away, quietly shuffling their busy feet—they trotted
One behind another). 
The evil of the blind sheep!

Like a discreetly planned conspiracy
They crowded in silently (as more passengers gushed 
Through the gates quickly) and—drowned her—completely. 
Her identity hushed and dissolved. 
After a while, I pondered:
What does this world have 
To afraid of insanity?
