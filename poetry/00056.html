<h1>The trial of a public enemy</h1>
<pre>
Two circles were formed: 
The inner circumference 
Formed a ring of emptiness (hollow
And vacant their eyes glowed), and
The outer border compassed with
Judgemental hatred (but
I saw their faces framed -- frightfully with fear).

Apparently, she's intruded the harmony, 
And invaded this world (this
Confined box -- the claustrophobic breathed
Hard against the glass -- through the window, 
Gasping for air -- and felt a lot better). 
Like primitive humanoids she placed herself right 
In the centre, and questioned her chorus.

Her lunacy's her most eloquent alibi -- she was not here. 
Like a beast, escaped and out of place, 
She sneered at the passengers around her
And sat down (more people moved 
Away, quietly shuffling their busy feet -- they trotted
One behind another). 
The evil of the blind sheep!

Like a discreetly planned conspiracy
They crowded in silently (as more passengers gushed 
Through the gates quickly) and -- drowned her -- completely. 
Her identity hushed and dissolved. 
After a while, I pondered:
What does this world have 
To afraid of insanity?
