<h1>Defeats</h1>
<pre>
Venomous tongue, sneering jest—
Such was the poison of my foe. 
Toiling my heart, halting its rest, 
The vile has spread from head to toe. 
'Twas then it stirred, awaken from its sleep, 
Suddenly sprung to its vicious might. 
It drew a wound, which was bitterly deep, 
And claimed my mind as its sinful right. 
The creature rolled, to the lowlife it scowled; 
Like a puppet I did the same. 
The monster roared, to the bastard it growled; 
And the same dark thing I, too, became. 
I cursed my enemy, like a savage. 
He looked back with a knowing smile. 
I leaped closer, ready to do ravage, 
As 'nother placed my soul on trial. 
Had I used my fangs, or waved my claws, 
And battered to wreck his worthless corpse. 
He would have won, for I've showed my flaws, 
And I've lost myself in the beast's course. 
So instead, I held my stare and digressed its way; 
Smothered the fire my anger did set 'flame. 
Then I clenched my fist, took a breath and walked away, 
'Til I drew back from him my wrath and blame.
