<h1>You have analysed enough</h1>
<pre>
You have analysed enough. Picked them over
Until they are fit and dour. They are ready. 
They will not go wrong.
This is all planned for.

You hover critically over the clouds, 
Beyond the control of your craft—your subjects, 
They will never reach you 
From their sterilised jar

Made clean and faultless—
They are looking up because of it, 
Hands clawing at the sky, mouths in the shape of O. 
Ever faithful, your disciples,

But they have failed you. You know this.
You remain meta, 
Unaffected by their prognosis. Useless particles. 
You have analysed enough,

Seen enough. You would have loved to react, 
But you cannot. 
You get up to work
Yet another miracle.
