<h1>Dryad meeting<br><span class='dedication'>—dedicated to S</span></h1>
<pre>
I did not see the dryad, 
But her presence felt
In the lightness of leaves— 
Those papery bells;
In gentle leaps of beams 
Of shimmering rays—
No reflection was seen
Save the shades of day.

I could not see the dryad
As much as I tried:
But she was musical
In her trail of light.
She utilised no spell—
She needn't use it—
Her songs captured enough
With their softer chimes.

I would not see the dryad
For fear I might fall;
For she was more delight
Than the quickest veil;
And even quicker still
Was that flight of dream—
Oh! I would not see her
Lest of her I dream!
