<h1>Red balloon</h1>
<pre>
Some days, I am a red balloon, 
so full of love that I am going to burst,

so fearful of delights that 
lift me up too high.  

My will is inconsequential, 
puppeteered by the summer winds; 

but I float, always, 
against the sad, hopeful clouds.

<h1>Monday's slow roast</h1>
<pre>
In the centre of that place where time burns like fire, 
    every clock is long; 
    every moment is Monday's 
    slow roast over the sunlight.

<h1>The sleepless</h1>
<pre>
Those days of dreams and dampness
-- of symbols large enough to settle
-- of insects pale-almost-translucent
with their fearsome mandibles.
They have their innards stolen; they toil
hard, my wakeful tenants, 
always carving away pieces within me
to stuff their hungry husks.
We fight all the time.  I for what I am 
left with; they for the lack.

<h1>Delphi</h1>
<pre>
I have stolen words 
from divinity, 

appropriated them 
for personal means; 

these sounds form 
not phrases,

but consonants in 
the dark; 

and I remain
inscrutable and

refusing to pass; 
but I am not.  

No,
I am not.

<h1>Lights off</h1>
<pre>
I switch the lights off, 
then on, then off, 

and then on.  I do it 
one room at a time, 

so I can find 
the dark 

and keep it cornered -- 
stare right into 

its lightless eyes -- 
one, 

one, 
and then another -- 

lonely organs of 
the night -- by the last hour 

they would all shut 
and die.
