<h1>Delphi</h1>
<pre>
I have stolen words 
from divinity, 

appropriated them 
for personal means; 

these sounds form 
not phrases,

but consonants in 
the dark; 

and I remain
inscrutable and

refusing to pass; 
but I am not.  

No,
I am not.

<h1>Of immortality</h1>
<pre>
Could we do that?  Feed
the magnificent dark river.
Fill its palate.  Pick and toss.
Could we afford
not laying them out with 
disclaimers 
and quotes?  
What if we do it in silence?  
Could we
really?  In selfless, shameful
servitude to a greater being, 
and in this sense become
purer than anything?
Oh, small mortals
stealing foreign fire to light
the way.  What do we know
of immortality?

<h1>A watcher<br /><span class="dedication">-- dedicated to Doris</span></h1>
<pre>
I am a watcher next to the passing river; 
     and I rest, right here.

<h1>Lights off</h1>
<pre>
I switch the lights off, 
then on, then off, 

and then on.  I do it 
one room at a time, 

so I can find 
the dark 

and keep it cornered -- 
stare right into 

its lightless eyes -- 
one, 

one, 
and then another -- 

lonely organs of 
the night -- by the last hour 

they would all shut 
and die.

<h1>Emeraldcrest<br /><span class="dedication">-- dedicated to Cori</span></h1>
<pre>
The pyramid rose over 
stony bed.  White shells toiled 

amidst alabaster froth.  
Base upon base, 

rock upon rock.  The great emergence 
over sandy lot.  

A gasp -- a cry -- 
an exclamation, "Emeraldcrest!"

The billow came and 
claimed the plot.

<article>
<h1>Home</h1>
<pre>
Home is such a place
Where everything unused is piled upon.
You could name every item that you own
Save those that you do not.
The little things break 
And come out as shards on top; 
The hardest, 
Most Important Thing sits as
The foundation -- rots.
