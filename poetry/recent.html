<h1>Back at this corner</h1>
<pre>
Back at this corner purplish and blue listening 
     to the streets waking up.

<h1>The cats and the birds<br><span class="dedication">—dedicated to Cori</span></h1>
<pre>
Cori likes to play the piano 
when I play the piano.

A note here.
A note there.

"The notes are like birds, 
like feathers," she said. 

"The rests
are like cats.

When the cats come, 
the birds fly away."

<h1>The sleepless</h1>
<pre>
Those days of dreams and dampness
—of symbols large enough to settle
—of insects pale-almost-translucent
with their fearsome mandibles.
They have their innards stolen; they toil
hard, my wakeful tenants, 
always carving away pieces within me
to stuff their hungry husks.
We fight all the time. I for what I am 
left with; they for the lack.

<h1>Delphi</h1>
<pre>
I have stolen words 
from divinity, 

appropriated them 
for personal means; 

these sounds form 
not phrases,

but consonants in 
the dark; 

and I remain
inscrutable and

refusing to pass; 
but I am not. 

No,
I am not.
