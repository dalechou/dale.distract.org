<h1>The poet's abuse</h1>
<pre>
The gatherer held the pages 
As if they were his throat. 
(Clutched tight.)  He pronounced 
With his dried lungs
The tuber of injustice—grown 
For the sole purpose 
To oppose him.

''Twas the end of October, 
And the world bore fruits of
Ill-tempered joy amidst 
The sickly air.'

'The season was wrong, that's why
I remained 
Sterile—
Exactly where I was
A year ago.'  (Such violence;

Such tyranny.)
