<h1>The lectors</h1>
<pre>
We have spoken enough, 
Not amongst ourselves, but 
By ourselves and to ourselves. 
We have filled our soft bellies 
Round and plump; sat enough to 
Spill words after words; made 
Toasts to the ample supplies 
Of seats and beverages. 

We have spoken too much. 
Hasty compositions held fast by 
Quicker constructions. We have 
Basked ourselves in comfort and 
Appealed to the power of soliloquy. 
Voices unmade us, left us dry 
And scrawny with the echoes 
Of personal consolation.
