<h1>The sanctuary</h1>
<pre>
I've turned to the faded memory like a drowning man, 
Gasping for a quick short breath in hope that I'm still sane. 
Brushing away the neon light the traffic the blast of heat, 
Desperately trying to find my very own heartbeat. 
The only harbour I've left was part of the faded memory, 
In this blasphemous nocturnal world it was the only sanctuary. 
Eluded from the nightmares, the shelter was the boundless sky, 
The watchful guardian angels, the canopy of stars please hear my cry. 
Swiftly and smoothly as blissful dream the stream went by, 
Reflecting the delusive atmosphere and let out a soft sigh. 
The soft humming water brushed by as always and provided serenity, 
For aeon for time beyond my timeless sanctuary shall hold infinity.
