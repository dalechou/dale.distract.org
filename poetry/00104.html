<h1>A street commentary</h1>
<pre>
I heard the army was involved, but 
No blood was shed 
Under the white-splashed sun. (If there was 
I did not see). The city was 
Muted under the great heat.

They have barred the spectators 
Out of sight. The vociferation was
'Barbaric.' 
(There they hunted men 
And women on the street.)

The walls and words 
Were the only witnesses, but 
They were silent. 
The previous residents, who protested 
(And caused a traffic jam) were

Insignificantâ€”

A passerby 
Even more so.
