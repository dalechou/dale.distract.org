<h1>A madman's manifesto</h1>
<pre>
Behind these walls I've worked night and day; 
Beyond that door they are built with clay. 
There's a dead weight on my leaden-neck --
The pen has dried, and my tongue is tied, 
The madman has created his mad creations behind that door. 
"What monster have I made today?"
What victor has that mouth to say? 
Coughs -- coarse and dry --
Inhaling twigs by twigs, 
And there they sprouted verses and rhymes --
There they scratched sonnets 
With words like "thee," "thou," and "thine." 
The world rained-away anyway --
And he -- soaked of death -- has learnt to decay.
