<h1>Turquoise city</h1>
<pre>
    Stopped time, they did.
It was a collective effort in a
Delicate city in a single frame.
Silver clad, it had to be precious 
Metal. Cars had their spires caught
In motion. Men and women met, 
Mouths ajar and cheeks waxy.
Now that everything was immobile, 
It was the perfect time to learn
Each other's names. It was rainy
Enough to comment on the weather, 
But the rain became light
The moment it touchedâ€”very kind 
To the travellers and the vendors, 
Who traded names with each other
For the same nomadic reasons.
