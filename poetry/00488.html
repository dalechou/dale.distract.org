<h1>Connected</h1>
<pre>
My friend rented a place in Taipei and 
died by suicide -- or her heart had failed -- that was 
the account provided by her family. 

Her phone and internet persona would remain 
connected for months afterwards. It was difficult 
for the rest of us. It was difficult knowing

that I was on a trip to Bangkok 
with my family, where I watched television at night, 
and allowed people to take care of me. 

On our way home, the plane was held on the tarpit for an hour 
to give way to a certain high official attending 
a cremation ceremony. The passengers waited in silence.

I did not bring my phone to the trip. 
I wanted it to be reclusive and protected, but everything 
remained connected.
