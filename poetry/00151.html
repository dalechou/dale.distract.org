<h1>The stargazer<br /><span class="dedication">—dedicated to S</span></h1>
<pre>
Sunday night. The wind was kind.
The window was forced ajar.

Paused for a quiescence of time
I plunged from a wooden pane.

I brought forth the balmy bats;
I descended through the streets.

I crossed the shaded cities
And walked with the vagaries.

By the lake of reveries
The Butterfly Lily kissed.

But when her lips dawning bleached
She has forgot about me!

O! dear inamorata,
Could you really have forgot?

Nigh the summer midnight bells
You've taken a part of me.

Bereft of you I return
Once more to the wooden pane.

At a locked window I woed
To the torpid misery.

Could you coldly abandon
One solemn rain-kissed traveller?

He who most in need of you—
My e'er-fixed Cynosure!
