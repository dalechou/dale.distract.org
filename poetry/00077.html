<h1>Two</h1>
<pre>
<span class="part">Picture i</span>

Two sat next to each other on their way home. 
Their conversation raised no more attention 
Than a whisper, but that which seemed like a teardrop 
Near her sight did enough
To avert my head to an unnatural angle. 
I could not bear the view. 
I faced the window 
And the sub-terrestrial path clicked on.

Tools were used to engrave: on spell-bound 
Earth; on magnificent brick-walls; on 
Domestic caves; on men-held livestock; 
And on the back of a young girl, 
Who had to withstand the knife-cuts 
Given by her father.

<span class="part">Picture iii</span>

Her lips half-ajar -- and her eyes 
Were just as reticent.  Her back 
Leaned against the glass wall. 
There were things pasted over 
By the subway folds, and 
There were troubles left untold. 
Her friend brushed her cheek motherly
And held her hand, but she remained 
Unmoved and immobile.  Her fingers
Languidly slipped and remained cold. 
I watched and wondered: what 
Was powerful enough to nullify 
The expression of that round-faced girl?

The shirt-stain has caught attention
In its alarming-red.  It has raised questions 
In offensive profusion.  The answer was found, 
But the solution remained unanswered. 
There was nothing to do 
Save to clean up the blood-blotch.  Those 
Were difficult tasks, and some pain 
Would always remain 
Unwashed.
