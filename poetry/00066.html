<h1>A mother's consent</h1>
<pre>
Indeed it was lovely—

The sight of a mother who has managed
To smile without a trace of grief
For her child,

Who has muttered words of hatred
And vowed to kill (later on—
Mocked the death of his grandfather
By his bleached bed-sheet-white—

He mimicked 
Every gasping breath 
Oh-so-vividly—

Pink with giggles)—damned was that
Pulsing humanity.

Averted for the innocence—I tried
To understand the incomprehensible.
