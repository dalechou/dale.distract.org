<h1>They call this poetry</h1>
<pre>
They call this poetry, but 
You know better. This is sorcery!

The making art. The instruments for basic experiments: 
Vials 
Not made of glass, 
But of the thinnest film of words self-attaching 
The beginning to the end, 

Within which loops of time are measured with exactitude,
Two equal parts to each side; a time traveller's 
Arrowhead—

One shot—a green flame; an utterance bellowing
Thunderbursts through the throat, and off

You go. 
You wanted rain; it rains. You wanted the hard 
And the cold; 

By now you've drawn in lungsful of air. Enough. 

The space ants 
Hover over cold metal. You read between the lines
Like an inspector 
For a miniature palm-top factory.

The rhymes produce, tempt: make easy, 
Make do—
The music comes again, 
Sprouting midnight tunes from the centre of your hand—this 

Is the craft, the ever-restless band of
Monotonist strides, and it grows
So long, so well.
It grows big. 

Big enough to stopper the universe
And remain invisible 
In the starless sky.
