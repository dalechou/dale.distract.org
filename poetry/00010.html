<h1>Mirror</h1>
<pre>
It all started that day when I glance beyond the separation. 
He seemed quite the same, like any urban reflection: 
Obedient to everything I do and whatever I said. 
He was pale, weary, tired, all worn out, living, dead!

The two imperishable walls of prison, 
Prohibited his freedom. 
Look at the burnished glass! 
The dark essence of the glass
Exhibited him and deprived him. 
What about the filthy wall behind him? 
They, emotionless, out of feeling, 
Just another cold thing! 
I had to save him, 
I broke the prison to save him. 
To free him.
