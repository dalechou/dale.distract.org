<h1>Three children</h1>
<pre>
Three children got together
To choose their superpowers
At the meeting of the heroes.

Superpowers must be unique.
Superpowers must be intuitive.
Superpowers must be used
With great caution: saved and tested
Only in dire moments of need

The first child was quick to choose.
'Superior strength,' he said.

The power to lift up trees and
Buses and even aeroplanes,
With a single hand.

The second child gave it some thought,
And decided on superior wisdom
In the end. He would know
The secrets of his foes; the answer
To the universe, everything, and all.

The third child saw
That he was late, and no greater gift could be had

For the mind and the physique. There was
No greater mastery. 'What about 
The space and time?'

The third child enquired, but his peers
Would never allow for that!
'Space and time are off-limits, and
You know it.'  Of course, they were indeed
Powerful and right.

Their advice must be acknowledged.
'Invisibility then,'

The third child eventually settled
For less, but actually meaning metempsychosis.
The power to endure

Through the excision of the soul; through the blindness,
And all; through the effects of the internetâ€”
The plights of the world
Behind an obscure curtain, before the eyes stark
And wild

And licked; by the cinders that waited for 
The deaths of the powerful and right.
