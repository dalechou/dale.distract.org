<h1>Shroom people</h1>
<pre>
Shroom people, they are called. 
They live underground.
They travel like shadows, devoid of sound.

They stretch from one lit area to another, transit 
Between colour-coded lines—turn 
From point to point, measuring departures 

With time. They have survived today. 
They are not going to fall. These are good people—
Strong people. These always float.

And they shall all bloom 
Marble-veined and fat—
Emergent—resilient—spreading

Bitter spores against
The brilliant light.
