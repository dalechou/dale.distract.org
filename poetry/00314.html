<h1>Stars<br><span class='dedication'>—dedicated to Choco</span></h1>
<pre>
Above, 
A window left ajar; through it 
I can almost see the stars that
Light in their meanings 
With a single frame—
A named universe—a crystal plane. 

I can see the constellation 
Through a common tongue 
That is etched—articulated—
Through a spoken mind—
A set point of view, from
A set space and time:

I have provided weights and
Colours for the words of the night;
I have stories in stones 
From this hollow that I dwell; 
I can almost see the stars, 

But the stars are hidden 
From their historical paths
To provide an eternal view—
To be called for 
And defined.
The stars innumerate still—for
The denomination of the sky.
