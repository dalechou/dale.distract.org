<h1>I've been disappearing for years</h1>
<pre>
I've been disappearing for years,
Every three months, at season's turn.
I was gone in the first of spring.
The world was colour. I was not.
Summer came with the full of limn.
I stood removed—and absent still.
When autumn brought a page of thoughts,
I remained cold—a perfect stone;
For I am winter's sole device,
And I have been disappearing
Now—then—and to my own—demise.
