<h1>The time with you</h1>
<pre>
Did I tell you that I love to be with you? 
Those sweet sensations were unforgettable. 
The brief moments of a several blissful hours
Which ended only too soon. 
You endeared me, and
Dissolved the melancholy fear
That took away the colours of the world; 
Imprinted
The memories that give
Warmth and support to my heart. 
The indescribable calmness
After all the madness
Of the storm. 
Euphoria, was
An unfamiliarity to me, but
I found it with ease
Whilst I was with you.
