<h1>The shadow</h1>
<pre>
I cannot forget: as I chased after the soles of 
Past literary greats, I discovered 
The tallest of them all. 

The shelter of his magnificent boots 
Dwarfed even the turmeric pillars of the hall 
Like ancient ships destined for greatness,
Bellowing for humility even at a stop.

His hull impending, reaching 
Into the gust of tomorrow, 
Into the requirements to fulfil
As he beached and toiled by the shore. 
I thumbed through the numbers 

With careful agility, but the words 
Washed his torso like tides, 
Tireless with repetition, wearing him long,
Until—one loud thump, the closing of a book. 

I stirred. Looked up. 
Almost crushed 
            By the idea of the shadow,
Illimitable sails of grey—a magical carrier 
Of infinite full and light.
