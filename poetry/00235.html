<h1>Thing</h1>
<pre>
Thing, I know you. 
I have other names for you, 
But I must keep you there,
Where it is truest. 

I cannot provide for you. 
I know the stuff that makes you 
Stronger, at mark, when all is bleak. 
At the cost of all that is definite

With fulfilment, a full wound opens
And welcomes like a door. 
It is there that I will inherit you
Like a port in submission; 

Despite nomenclature 
Know that you are not void, but
Weighty and indivisible. 
Thing, I know you. 

I have other names for you, 
But I must keep you there, here, 
Right in between of being found and 
Named, in the ambiguity akin to home.
