<h1>The world is made up of nouns</h1>
<pre>
The world is made up of nouns. I am sure
You see it, too. You have referred to them 
Like I have; and would have continued to
If not for one tourist-scholar faithfully committed
To read the world with his broken tongue. 
Now the world is repeated in easy similars—
Alike, but undone. You understand 
That a copy can only resemble, 
Can only reduce and be basic. You now bear
Witness to the construction of depths and
Richer meanings. The proliferation is inevitable;
The wealth of notions—exchangeable.
Context multiplies 
Like currencies; leaving behind a world barren
And scarred with annotation, encyclopaedic in nature, 
Always deferring to, always incomplete, and asking.
Always asking for more.
