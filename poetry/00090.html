<h1>The ice cream man</h1>
<pre>
We spotted him by the street, behind 
Two metal containers. We paused
And asked for two. His prices were 
No where to be seen, and we did not know
The flavours, too.

Until—
Beneath a red cloak, they were 
Unveiled. A quick slip of stiletto
Drew a crown to the cone. 
We reached for it,

But he—a magician in disguise, (with 
A swift shift of hands) saved the cone
From our weary clutch—he was not satisfied! 
His mastery was art, and 
Not for our careless handling.

Our fatigue fled—

For sport! Our hands danced
In the air, chasing his dexterity. 
The game was a flirt. 
Our child-like clumsiness blushed amidst 
The crowd. He smiled and sang
A song of chocolate.

We left soon after—
Our palates froze as we licked our trophies 
Away—we spoke of poetry, and life 
Enlivened, each with a little surprise.
