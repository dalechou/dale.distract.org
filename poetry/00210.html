<h1>I gazed with great warmth</h1>
<pre>
I gazed with great warmth past
The depth of the warehouse:
They painted the eaves grey
So that it would rain in May.
I hid my personal message
In my warmer side pocket, and
Could remember just enough
To bring my ears to heart.
A dirty yellow cur
Carried its bare little head,
Lopsided eyes watching ants
That crawled the wall.
Everything they said was real:
Time was the invention,
And temporality the painâ€”
So many questions remained.
So I kept my glasses on, and
Contained the watery sight,
And it would be rainy still
Again, tonight.
