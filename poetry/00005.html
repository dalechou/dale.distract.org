<h1>Solitude<br /><span class="dedication">-- dedicated to Kielo</span></h1>
<pre>
Interlaced through the dark shades of edges, 
I listened for the music of all ages. 
It was between the pale foams --
I knew I stood alone.

Then came the starlight showering of loneliness, 
I waved around frantically, under madness. 
With a blink I had neither speech nor sight. 
In my heart there were neither guidance nor light.

Her voice rose from afar, 
It was so near, yet so far. 
The soft sigh came inside without her invitation card, 
Perhaps all these were the side effects of the colourful drug?

Tell me the difference between the fallen city wall
And the ones that stood proudly tall! 
Only fragments of the sandcastle were left, 
And soon, only the drowning streams of sins would be kept.
