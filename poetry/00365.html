<h1>Sometimes I have romantic thoughts</h1>
<pre>
Sometimes I have romantic thoughts.
They don't make a lot of sense, which makes them gruesome. 
For example: if I should perish, and they
My failed rescuers
Should discover a white band close to the base of my finger, 
Cut deep into me because it was 
Where I had previously promised 
For the act of preservation central to some bizarre rescue
That I could never by myself remove—
Where allowances were made;
They would do it for me.
