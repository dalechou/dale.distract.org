<h1>Phone sex</h1>
<pre>
She was 18/f Kitty.  She did a lot of purrs.
She called herself pussycat 
And would eventually be a nurse.

She called me Master.  
She got on her knees.  She said she wanted me
All of me because she was nearly there; 

But she didn't need me.  She was already screaming 
Quick quick quick quick into
My empty, thirsty ear.
