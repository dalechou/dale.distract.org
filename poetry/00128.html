<h1>The eavesdropper's notes</h1>
<pre>
The man blurted 
Forwards with one sudden movement. Laughed he, 
And his feet trotted happily—tap-danced; 
Backside heavily mounted, unmoved
Even by his assertion.

'One must set his life free
And fly!'  He exclaimed. 
He spoke of life.

He was the master 
Entertainer, every inch 
And jerk of lard pronounced 
Words of wisdom, 'Find your balance!' 
'Chase your dream!'

'Be yourself!'

Marketing slogans bannered full-lips
As he drummed them for his audience of two young women, 
Who politely stayed and listened, and I—who wrote this
For my private means of contempt.
