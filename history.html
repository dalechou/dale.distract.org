<h1>History of distract.org</h1>
<p>distract.org was used for distrACT projects (distributing internet service through real action). The goal was to establish an open community to encourage creativity on the internet by providing internet service pro bono. It was believed that, 'no one, especially the likes of poets, writers, musicians, and artists, should have to travail through the instability of poor quality service providers for a venue of expression.'</p>
<p>The server, isis2, was powered by CentOS 6 64-bit, with 1.5 GB RAM, 60 GB storage, and hardware RAID 10. It was accessible at the IPv4 address of 209.50.248.203. distrACT was operational for more than a decade. When isis2 shut down on 17 April 2015, it was serving 44 accounts.</p>
<h1>And now?</h1>
<p>Now distract.org only hosts personal projects via GitHub. The 'main site' points to dale.distract.org via 301 forwarding to reflect this change. The structure and design of the site is kept modular on purpose. The main site has become an <a href='./index.html'>index</a> to several (sub)sites, each representing an independent personal project.</p>
